      The last few months have been a transformative time for Swarm. Development
      is progressing on multiple fronts, and the hard work of the research and
      development teams is reflected by network growth and performance
      improvements. In this article we discuss the state of the network on
      multiple fronts. We’ll kick things off with an overview of Swarm network
      economics and network growth. In the next section we will tackle the issue
      of network capacity, and to wrap things up we’ll take a closer look at how
      the recent developments on the Bee client have led to advances in network
      performance.

      June marked an important point in the Swarm network development. The new
      localstore was released on private and public testnet and the new revised
      and updated edition of the Book of Swarm is now available. The Research
      Track has also made it much easier to find nodes that couldn’t enter the
      storage incentives game and understand the circumstances.
