        ## Setting up and interacting with a Bee node is optimised for
        ease-of-use


        Any crypto enthusiast with an interest in Swarm can set up and run a Bee
        node easily.


        ## Measuring Success


        * Setting up a node (including crypto-onboarding) on Mac, Windows and
        Linux can be done in under 30' in >70% of the cases (both mainnet and
        testnet)

        * User funds are reasonably secure and this is guaranteed by an audit

        * There are multiple documented ways of monitoring and interacting with
        a Bee node

        * Setting up a Bee-Gateway is documented and easy to set up


        ## Time Estimate


        Q2 2022


        ## Value


        If it is trivial to set up a Bee node, more of them will be set up,
        which will result in a stronger network. More people will be able to
        publish and access content (Milestone #1). Through the gateway set-up,
        developers and communities can easily access the Swarm network.
