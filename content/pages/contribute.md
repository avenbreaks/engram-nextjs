            Swarm Improvement Proposals (SWIPs) describe standards for the Swarm
            platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and
            contract standards. Interested parties can follow the the SWIP
            process to submit their specification proposals on said topics. It
            is best to first test the ideas for proposals with the rest of the
            Swarm community on the [Swarm Discord](https://discord.ethswarm.org)
            channels, followed up by formalising them in the [SWIP
            repository](https://github.com/ethersphere/SWIPs/).



            More information can be found in the [SWIP
            readme](https://github.com/ethersphere/SWIPs#readme). A browsable
            version of all current and draft SWIPs can be found on
            [GitHub](https://github.com/ethersphere/SWIPs/tree/master/SWIPs).
