        ## Phase 1 - Postage stamp upgrade and incentives calibration (September
        12th release)


        * Full reserve total size is correctly calculated and clients are able
        to consent on storage depth within neighbourhoods. This involves the
        update of the Postage Stamp smart contract so that we can release the
        value currently locked in the contract, paving the way for the rollout
        of the storage incentives roadmap.


        ## Phase 2 - Smart Contracts to deploy (Staking &
        Schelling/Redistribution) (phases 2&3 October release to incentivised
        testnet)


        * The new storage incentives implement a Schelling game based on reserve
        commitment. The storage incentives contract pays out the pot to a random
        neighbourhood choosing the winner node based on neighbourhood stake
        density. No slashing and no verification of claim.

        * After staking and committing, applicants reveal their reserve
        commitments and the truth is selected in proportion to stake density.
        Winner is selected in proportion to stake and paid the pot.


        ## Phase 3 - The Price Oracle smart contract (to be completed in Q3
        2023)


        * The price oracle contract reacts to signals of changing supply and
        demand by setting the global price of storage (unit is chunk per block)
        accordingly.


        ## Phase 4 - Reserve Commitment Verification I (to be completed in Q3
        2023)


        * The winning claim is verified for retention, relevance, reserve
        utilisation rate, verified correctness of reserve commitment, requiring
        segment inclusion proof of a deterministically random chunk in RC for
        valid claim (proof of retention), requires postage stamp (proof of
        relevance), verify PO(stamp, anchor) > reported depth, reserve size
        estimation is based on inclusion proofed sample density (proof of
        reserve size).

        * Calculated the reserve commitment (RC) hash (iteration over reserved
        chunks within storage depth and calculate a sample of n (128) chunks
        whose transformed data hash to the smallest integers).

        * Slashing introduced - to prevent non-conformant proofs of reserve by
        slashing stake


        ## Phase 5 - Reserve Commitment Verification II (to be completed in Q3
        2023)


        * A secondary reserve commitment (RC2) is included in the winning claim
        and verified in the contract. RC2 is a similar 128-chunk sample of batch
        indexes to prevent content mining attack using valid stamps from
        self-owned batches
